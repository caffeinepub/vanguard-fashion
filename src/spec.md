# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the placeholder Vanguard branding with the TS Gabrielle brand logo and name throughout the application.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the "Vanguard" text logo in the header with the tsgabrielle logo, using the purple version for light mode and white version for dark mode
- Update all text references from "Vanguard" to "TS Gabrielle" throughout the application including page titles, meta tags, and UI text
- Ensure the logo is clickable and navigates to the homepage
- Maintain responsive design and existing navigation functionality

**User-visible outcome:** The application displays the TS Gabrielle brand logo in the header (with theme-appropriate colors) and uses the correct brand name throughout all text content.
