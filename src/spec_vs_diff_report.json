  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-8 (logo replacement with theme-based switching) and REQ-9 (brand name updates) with high fidelity. The Layout component now displays theme-aware logos, the HTML title is updated, and most 'Vanguard' references are replaced with 'TS Gabrielle'. However, one instance of 'Vanguard' terminology remains in the Home page content ('Vanguardist Design'), which appears to be intentional descriptive language rather than brand naming.",

      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Footer and any other branded text areas use the correct brand name",
      "reason": "The diff shows Layout.tsx is truncated at the footer section. Cannot verify if footer branding was updated from 'Vanguard' to 'TS Gabrielle'.",
