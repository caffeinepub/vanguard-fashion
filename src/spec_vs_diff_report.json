  "summary": "The diff implements a transparent header with mega menu navigation and holographic effects. All four requirements (REQ-14 through REQ-17) are addressed with transparent backdrop-blur header, mega menu dropdowns on hover, holographic borders on navigation elements and cart icon, and holographic effects on mega menu panels.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Mobile-responsive behavior that collapses to accordion or drawer",
      "reason": "The mobile menu implementation in Layout.tsx uses the existing simple mobile menu structure (basic links in a collapsible div), not the enhanced accordion/drawer behavior requested for the mega menu's mobile view. The MegaMenu component is only rendered in desktop view (hidden md:flex) and the mobile menu does not display the mega menu content structure.",
